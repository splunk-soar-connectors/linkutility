This app generates a widget with links. Each link will open in a new tab.
<br><br>
When adding links, they can either be appended to existing links with the append boolean or the new links can overwrite the old links.
<br><br>
You can either add a single link and description at a time or you can use json to add multiple links at once.
<br><br>
For a single link, you can add the url in the url field and the link text in the description field.
<br><br>
For multiple links at once, you can pass in a list of dictionaries in this format:
<code><pre>
[
    {
        "descriptor":"Google Search",
        "url":"https://www.google.com"
    },
    {
        "descriptor":"Splunk Documentation",
        "url":"https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation"
    },
    {
        "descriptor":"VirusTotal",
        "url":"https://www.virustotal.com"
    }
]
</pre></code>

Make sure the url begins with http(s). If you don't, your links won't open in a new window properly.
